# Wireshark Capture Packets
## Overview
This project focuses on using Wireshark to analyse network traffic, filter packets, and identify key network activity.

- Setup Wireshark: Installed and configured Wireshark on Ubuntu, ensuring secure user permissions for packet capturing.
- Capture Packets: Started and saved packet captures on an Ethernet interface to monitor network traffic.
- Filter HTTPS Traffic: Used display filters to identify HTTPS packets and extract destination IPs.
- Identify Website IPs: Captured packets from Google searches, filtered TLS handshake data, and analysed IP-specific traffic.
- Capstone Task: Captured HTTP and HTTPS packets, isolated web traffic, and filtered out a specific IP address from the capture.
